# What Keeps Us Listening? Exploring the Determinants of Popularity on Spotify. 

## Overview

Musicians frequently wonder what parts of their compositions make their songs popular. This paper uses Spotify-generated metrics from the discographies of Billboard's top 100 artists, accessed through the Spotify API, to analyze which, if any, specific audio qualities have an impact on a song's assigned popularity score.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from the Spotify API using spotifyr.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and rough sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.

## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of my R code and paper were written and edited with the assistance of Large Language Models, in particular Claude-3 Haiku (Claude.ai) and GPT-4 (ChatGPT). The chat history with both models are available in inputs/llms.
