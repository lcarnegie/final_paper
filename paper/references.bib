	abstract = {The importance of quantifying the nature and intensity of emotional states at the level of populations is evident: we would like to know how, when, and why individuals feel as they do if we wish, for example, to better construct public policy, build more successful organizations, and, from a scientific perspective, more fully understand economic and social phenomena. Here, by incorporating direct human assessment of words, we quantify happiness levels on a continuous scale for a diverse set of large-scale texts: song titles and lyrics, weblogs, and State of the Union addresses. Our method is transparent, improvable, capable of rapidly processing Web-scale texts, and moves beyond approaches based on coarse categorization. Among a number of observations, we find that the happiness of song lyrics trends downward from the 1960s to the mid 1990s while remaining stable within genres, and that the happiness of blogs has steadily increased from 2005 to 2009, exhibiting a striking rise and fall with blogger age and distance from the Earth’s equator.},

	abstract = {In the music market, superstars significantly dominate the market share, while predicting the top hit songs is notoriously difficult. The music intelligence technology, retrieving and utilizing granular acoustic features of songs, provides opportunities to improve the prediction of top hit songs. Using data on 6209 unique songs that appeared in the weekly Billboard Hot 100 charts from 1998 to 2016, especially acoustic features provided by Spotify, we investigate empirically how the top-10-hit-songs likelihood prediction is improved by acoustic features. We find that some acoustic features (e.g., danceability, happiness, and some metrics of timbre and pitch) significantly improve the model's ability to predict the top-10-hit-songs probability. These results suggest that the granular data, provided by the music intelligence technology, carries a substantial predictive value in the era of online music streaming.},

	abstract = {The paper examines new record company formation by music composers. In particular, it addresses their decision to release a record i.e. either to contract their music to record companies or to start-up their own company. In so doing, the research entails the collection and analysis of new data on the behaviour of musicians in the intermediate market for music. The research finds that musicians regard incumbent record companies to have a first mover advantage and that they generally aspire to secure a record contract rather than set-up their own company. Composers who start-up their own company usually do so because of ‘push’ rather than ‘pull’ factors and hence usually represent artistic enterprise which has been rejected by incumbent firms. In this manner, new firm formation by composers does not appear to represent the seeds of future industry.},
