If I have the following metrics that denote audio data on songs from Spotify, suggest me some graphs that would allow me to explore the data better to get a fuller understanding.

Based on the metrics you have for audio data from songs on Spotify, you can explore the data better using various types of graphs. Here are some suggestions:

Histograms: You can create histograms for each of the numerical metrics like popularity, energy, valence, danceability, and liveliness. This will show you the distribution of each attribute across all songs.

Scatter Plots:

Scatter plots would be great for exploring relationships between two variables. For example, you could plot popularity against valence to see if there's any correlation between how positive a song is and how popular it is.
Another scatter plot could be danceability versus energy to see if more energetic songs tend to be more danceable.
Box Plots:

Box plots can give you a good visual summary of the distribution while also showing outliers. For instance, box plots for popularity or energy can quickly show the median, quartiles, and any outliers in the data.
Bar Graphs:

For the explicit and mode metrics which are categorical (0 or 1), bar graphs would be suitable. You could show the count of explicit versus non-explicit songs or the count of songs in major mode versus minor mode.
Heatmaps:

If you want to see the correlation between all these metrics, you could use a heatmap of the correlation matrix. This would allow you to quickly see which pairs of variables are positively or negatively correlated.
Time Series Analysis:

If your dataset includes timestamps or release dates for songs, you could analyze how these metrics change over time. For instance, plotting the average energy or danceability of songs by year could show trends in music preferences.
Bubble Charts:

Combine a scatter plot with a bubble chart, where the size of the bubble could represent a third variable like duration or popularity. This allows you to compare three variables at once.
Radar Charts:

If you want to compare multiple metrics for a set of songs or artists, radar charts can be useful. Each axis represents one metric, and you can visually compare the profiles of different songs or artists.
Violin Plots:

These are similar to box plots but also include a kernel density estimation. This would be particularly good for showing the distribution of metrics like valence or energy, as they give more nuanced insights into the data distribution than a simple box plot.
These visualizations will help you get a multi-dimensional understanding of your dataset and can uncover insights into the characteristics of songs on Spotify.
